# Simple_Functional_density

This includes files for the paper, Simple functional forms to describe density dependence during aquatic mosquito development. 
Coauthors: Michael A. Robert and Lauren M. Childs

* simplefunctional_forms_density.m runs a majority of the figures from the texts

* ViolinFig4.m runs the violin plots. Inorder to run this file, additional code from https://www.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23661-violin-plots-for-plotting-multiple-distributions-distributionplot-m was used

* runFmsSearchVar.m is an example of the minimization of the functions ran with the 50 initial samples

* FunctionRuns.mat is the actual numerical results from the minimization for each function type and variation.
